# TelegramConsole
A Spigot plugin that allows Minecraft server owners to interact with their console through Telegram. It can **read the output** and **execute** commands remotely ‚Äî these features alone make TelegramConsole the perfect companion when quick changes are needed for your server (you might as well forget about the classic console and switch to TelegramConsole altogether! üòÅ).

### Main features
- Read output
- Execute commands
- Format output appropriately (i.e. adequate usage of **bold**, *italic* and `code`)
- Smart multiple-lines detection (i.e. exceptions are stacked up to form a single message, rather than multiple ones due to line breaks)
- Forward exceptions to a separate and dedicated chat (extremely useful for keeping track of errors)

### Installation
1. Make sure you are running the latest release of TelegramCore, you can download it [here](http://)
2. Put the .jar file in the 'plugin' folder (both TelegramCore and TelegramConsole)
3. Start the server to generate config.yml
4. Create a group on Telegram and obtain its chat ID ([How to get the chatID](http://google.com))
5. Create a bot if you haven't already ([Ping @BotFather on Telegram](https://t.me/BotFather))
6. Insert the token of your bot in `plugins/TelegramConsole/config.yml`
7. Restart the server
8. Done! you can start interacting with your server console on Telegram
